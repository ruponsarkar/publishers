<br/>

<p><b>Plagiarism</b></p><br/>
<p>Plagiarism is copying another person’s text or ideas and passing the copied material as your own work. You must both delineate (i.e., separate and identify) the copied text from your text and give credit to (i.e., cite the source) the source of the copied text to avoid accusations of plagiarism. Plagiarism is considered fraud and has potentially harsh consequences including loss of job, loss of reputation, and the assignation of reduced or failing grade in a course”.
All manuscripts received towards Issra journals are scanned for plagiarism. If potential plagiarism is detected, authors will be contacted for clarification. The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others, it is necessary to indicate the source of the information within your paper using an internal citation.
</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Peer Review Policy</b></p>

<p>The practice of peer review policy is to ensure that only good science is published. It is an objective process at the heart of good scholarly publishing and is carried out by all reputable scientific journals. Our referees play a vital role in maintaining the high standards Transport Policy and all manuscripts are peer reviewed following the procedure outlined below</p>

<p><b>☛ Processing fee</b></p>

<p>Issra Publishers is an online international open access, peer reviewed journals publishing organization; we do not have funding/support from any Private Organizations/Government to run. To run our organization in an organized way, we charge manuscript processing fee from the authors to publish their manuscripts. We charge fee to maintain published manuscripts in online repositories. All our articles are published in most updated formats (HTML, PDF, etc.,)</p>

<p><b>☛ Manuscript Withdrawal Policy</b></p>

<p>Author may wish to withdraw his/her manuscript after submitting it to Issra Publishers. To withdraw a manuscript, we do not charge any fee, only if he/she withdraws it within a week.
If an author withdraws manuscript after a week, then he/she will be asked to pay partial processing fee. Each manuscript submission costs us (ISSRA Publishers) certain amount along with overhead cost during processing. Manuscripts peer review process is completed (which can often happen within a week), and it has been worked into a journal issue, we have incurred costs on our end that need to be reimbursed.
We ask authors to pay 30% of the original article processing fee in case of withdrawal
