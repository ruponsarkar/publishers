All manuscripts published by us are peer reviewed by our eminent editorial board members of the respective journals. We accept online letters or Emails from Editors as well as brief comments or changes that might enhance the quality of previously published articles. The manuscripts should be of high quality, reflect solid scholarship of the authors in their fields and the information contained should be accurate and reliable – prerequisites for maintaining the high standards we expect from the contributors. We consider manuscripts for publication from any part of the world and ensure that all submissions are refereed through a double-blind process. The quick and efficient review and publication process makes your Papers immediately available online to all the readers immediately upon publication. All our reviewers undertake to keep submitted manuscripts and associated data confidential and not redistribute them without permission from the journal. All the published content is permanently stored in our archives and we use Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to locate the Articles throughout the world. We warmly welcome authors to visit our site and submit their scientific papers to our journal.</p>
